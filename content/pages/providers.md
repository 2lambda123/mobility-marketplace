about: >
  This dataset includes known transportation providers in California, covering
  both public transit operators and special services that may not fall within
  standard definitions of transit. Each provider entry includes its headquarters
  city, counties where active, the associated National Transit Database ID
  (if available), the website URL, and key attributes from the NTD. It's
  currently limited to providers who operate their own services. This list is a
  living document that will be updated regularly with new service provider
  information. If you have comments, additions, or corrections to this dataset,

Transportation technology is improving rapidly, prompting innovation across both public and private sectors. The greatest benefits from technological advances will require greater interoperability, increased access to technology, and streamlined customer service.

To better understand the size and scale of opportunities for integration, the Cal-ITP team has compiled a list of transportation providers across the state of California.
