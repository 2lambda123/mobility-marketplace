  <h2>Contactless payments</h2>

  <p>
    California is making it easier for public transit providers to accept contactless credit/debit/prepaid cards or
    mobile wallets on a smart device through Master Service Agreements (MSAs) established by the California Department
    of General Services (DGS). Transit providers can take advantage of the MSAs to purchase the key hardware and
    software needed to accept contactless payments. (See the MSAs on our <a href="/contracts"
      target="_self">Contracts</a> page.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/Contactless-Payments-MSA-Information-Packet.pdf"
      target="_blank">
      Contactless Payments MSA Information Packet (PDF)</a> provides an overview of MSA-related information so you can
    familiarize yourself with the contract, and what steps your agency needs to take to move forward with buying from
    the MSAs.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re looking for an informational presentation on the MSAs for agency staff or your board of directors, this
    PDF is in slideshow format to meet those needs.
  </p>

  <h3>What else do I need to do to understand how contactless payments work?</h3>

  <p>
    After you’ve read through the Contactless Payments MSA Information Packet, move onto this <a
      href="https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/Contactless-Payments-Introduction.pdf" target="_blank">
      Contactless Payments Introduction (PDF)</a>. Geared toward transit agency staff, it contains:
  <ul>
    <li>an overview of the different components of a contactless payment system</li>
    <li>information on how contactless payment transactions work</li>
    <li>an explanation of what it means to become a merchant</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re looking for an informational presentation on contactless payments for agency staff or your board of
    directors, this PDF is in slideshow format to meet those needs.

  <h3>I’m ready to move forward—how do I draft a Scope of Work?</h3>

  <p>
    After you’ve read through the Contactless Payments MSA Information Packet and Contactless Payments Introduction,
    move onto this <a href="https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/MSA-SOW-Template-and-Guidance.pdf"
      target="_blank">MSA SOW Template and Guidance (PDF)</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This PDF provides detailed guidance for transit agency staff on how to complete a User Agreement Scope of Work as
    required to participate in the Master Service Agreements (MSAs) for Payment Acceptance Devices (PADs) and Transit
    Processor Services. Completing it will assist your agency with key scoping decisions as you work toward purchasing
    hardware and software services.
  </p>

  <h3>How much will this cost to implement?</h3>

  <p>When you’re ready to start creating cost estimates for purchasing contactless payment hardware and software
    services, this <a href="https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/MSA-Cost-Estimation-Tool.xlsx"
      target="_blank">Excel Workbook</a> will help transit agency staff to a) compare vendor prices and develop
    ballpark estimates for budgeting purposes (and board presentations), and b) make scoping and vendor decisions during
    the vendor engagement phase.
