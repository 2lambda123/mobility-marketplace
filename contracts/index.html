      the same benefits as pass holders once they reach the cap.

<p>
  On behalf of <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/" target="_blank">Caltrans</a>, Cal-ITP can connect transit providers with
  contracts and competitive pricing negotiated by the State of California (through a competitive Request for Proposals
  process) to help you modernize your transit system. We recommend creating an action plan for
  becoming GTFS-ready before going contactless, as the vendors you select can help you use this data for reporting
  purposes plus help your customers see your real-time vehicle location and fare information on journey-planning
  smartphone maps and apps.
