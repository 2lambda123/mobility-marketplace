      <p>
        California is making it easier for public transit providers to accept contactless credit/debit/prepaid cards or mobile
        wallets on a smart device through Master Service Agreements (MSAs) established by the California Department of General
        Services (DGS). Transit prividers can take advantage of the MSAs to purchase the key hardware and software needed to
        accept contactless payment.

      <h5>How do I get started?</h5>
      <p>
        Cal-ITP will provide the materials and support you need to navigate modernizing your fleet to accept contactless payment.
        To help us better assist you we ask that you complete an interest form for Cal-ITP support. With this information we can
        determine how best to support you with developing a project scope, getting buy-in from internal stakeholders, engaging
        with vendors, and implementing your new fare payment system. After you complete the form, we welcome you to browse this
        guide to understand the process and your next steps.

      <h5>What else do I need to know about Contactless Payments?</h5>
      <p>
        If you’d like to learn more about Contactless Payment or need an informational presentation to share with your staff or
        board of directors, please review this Contactless Payments Introduction (PDF).

      <h4 id="what-to-know-about-msas">What to know about MSAs</h4>
      <h5>What are MSAs</h5>
      <p>
        The California Department of General Services (DGS), in collaboration with Cal-ITP, conducted an RFP that established 6
        Master Service Agreements (MSAs) that allow Transit Providers to purchase directly without further competitive bidding.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MSAs allow any local government entities that operate public transportation services (“Transit Providers”) to purchase
        goods and services off the MSAs. Out-of-state Transit Providers—including but not limited to members of the Oregon
        Cooperative Procurement Program (ORCPP) and the Washington State Purchasing Cooperative (WSPC)—can also participate. Each
        Transit Provider should determine whether use of the MSAs is consistent with its procurement policies and regulations.
        California’s MSAs are generally known as State Purchasing Schedules in other states.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects resulting from these MSAs may be funded through grants from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and/or the
        State of California, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and other sources of local and state public
        funding. Check with your funding agencies.
      </p>
      <h4 id="gtfs-compliance">GTFS Compliance</h4>
      <p>
        We recommend creating an action plan for becoming GTFS-ready before going contactless, as the vendors you select can help
        you use this data for reporting purposes plus help your customers see your real-time vehicle location and fare information
        on journey-planning smartphone maps and apps.
      </p>
      <h4 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h4>
      <p>
        You’ll need to ensure internet connectivity on your fleet to power contactless fare collection. You can view details on
        Data Plans here. Your transit agency may be eligible to upgrade your data plan and save on your monthly connectivity
        costs.
      </p>
      <h4 id="how-much-will-it-cost">How much will it cost?</h4>
      <p>
        When you’re ready to start creating cost estimates for purchasing contactless payment hardware and software services, this
        Excel Workbook will help transit agency staff to a) compare vendor prices and develop ballpark estimates for budgeting
        purposes (and board presentations), and b) make scoping and vendor decisions during the vendor engagement phase.

        After you’ve read through the Contactless Payments MSA Information Packet and Contactless Payments Introduction, move onto
        this MSA SOW Template and Guidance (PDF).
      </p>
      <p>
        This PDF provides detailed guidance for transit agency staff on how to complete a User Agreement Scope of Work as required
        to participate in the Master Service Agreements (MSAs) for Payment Acceptance Devices (PADs) and Transit Processor
        Services. Completing it will assist your agency with key scoping decisions as you work toward purchasing hardware and
        software services.

      <h4 id="what-contracts-do-i-sign-with-selected-vendors">What contracts do I sign with selected vendors?</h4>
      <p>
        After you’ve finalized the details of your project with the vendor "contractors" you’ve selected, you’ll complete the
        California Department of General Services (DGS) standard agreement 213 with each vendor's contact information, sign it as
        the "contracting agency," and send a copy to DGS. (Note that you'll need Adobe Acrobat or Reader to complete this PDF
        form.)
