        California is making it easier for public transit providers to accept contactless credit/debit/prepaid cards or mobile
        wallets on a smart device through Master Service Agreements (MSAs) established by the California Department of General
        Services (DGS). Transit providers can take advantage of the MSAs to purchase the key hardware and software needed to
        accept contactless payments.
