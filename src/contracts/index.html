      Recognizes riders' unique payment methods and charges the best fare for each trip, accounting for applicable
      discounts and distance traveled. It also enables "fare capping," meaning that riders who pay as they go receive
      the same benefits as pass holders once they reach the cap.

      Fleet modernization and new vehicle technology are allowing us to be even more connected with our transit journeys.
      To do this, most require data access. These data plans are available to agencies with the pre-negotiated rates listed.

<p class="pb-3">
  The State of California has Master Service Agreements (MSAs) available to help you modernize your transit system.  To add contactless fare collection, you will need up to three new technologies and ensure internet connectivity on your fleet (if you don’t already have it).
</p>

<strong class="h4">Become GTFS-compliant first for best results</strong> <em class="subtext">Highly recommended</em>

<p class="mt-3">We recommend creating an action plan for becoming GTFS-ready before going contactless, as the vendors you select can help you use this data for reporting puerposes plus help your customers see your real-time vehicle location and fare information on journey-planning smartphone maps and apps.</p>
