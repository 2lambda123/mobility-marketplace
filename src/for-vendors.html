      <p>
        There are hundreds of public transit providers in California with no consistent approach to collect fares, verify
        eligibility for fare discounts, or provide up-to-date vehicle arrival information to riders. This lack of uniformity
        creates barriers for new riders, complicates travel across different systems, and can be expensive for agencies to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created and managed by Caltrans, the California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP) is a statewide initiative to unify
        transit in California with a common fare payment system, real-time data standard, and seamless verification of
        reduced-fare eligibility. 
      </p>
      <strong>We are working to create a true marketplace</strong>
      <p>
        We want to ensure transit agencies have access to innovative and affordable technologies to enable a better experience for
        riders. While we’ve primarily worked with California agencies, we have products for agencies all across the country. Reach
        out or view our <a href="/contracts/">MSAs</a> to learn more.
