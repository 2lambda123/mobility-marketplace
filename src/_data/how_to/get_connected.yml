          - text: From accepting mobile wallets for fare payments to giving the live location of a bus, transit is using more technology to improve the rider experience. Cellular data is the power behind this new technology. Types of devices may include&#58;

        paragraphs:
          - text: Your technology can be connected through multiple SIMs (one per device) or a single SIM (one in a router).
          - text: <h4 class="underline">Multiple SIMs</h4>
          - text: Each device could be powered by a SIM that connects to the network. These SIMs would have smaller data plans.

          - text: <h4 class="underline">Single SIM</h4>
          - text: A single router could provide connectivity to multiple devices. The router’s SIM would need a larger data plan.

          - text: Carriers provide different coverage depending on location, so it is important to evaluate which best covers your service area. You can use <a href="https://fcc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=6c1b2e73d9d749cdb7bc88a0d1bdd25b" target="_blank">FCC data</a> to evaluate Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T coverage.

        paragraphs:
          - text: If you already have a data plan, you can switch by either immediately canceling your current contract or by not renewing upon contract expiration.
          - text: If your contract is month-to-month, you can simply switch once your new contract is in place. This process tends to be easier and more seamless.
          - text: If your contract is on a fixed time period, you can switch when the old one expires. You will need to sync the start of the new contract with the expiration of the old one to reduce the risk of service lapse.

      - title: Why do the FirstNet plans have tiers? What do these tiers mean?
        url: "firstnet-tiers"
        paragraphs:
          - text: FirstNet created data plans tailored for transit agencies at a competitive price. The tiers incentivize more collective purchases and were designed to enable discounted rates in a way that works for their business case.
          - text: The FirstNet tier prices are based on bulk volume purchased on that contract vehicle, (i.e., total number purchased by all agencies combined, not the number of SIMs purchased by an individual agency). Tier II pricing is guaranteed through March 2024. When the Tier III threshold is reached, all agencies will see their plans further discounted.
      - title: Can FirstNet be used for any device and use case?
        url: "firstnet-devices-use-case"
        paragraphs:
          - text: FirstNet only works for operations-facing use cases, given it is a first responder network. This means it cannot be used for passenger WiFi. Additionally, devices are required to have an additional security certification to operate on the federal network. This certification is common but not universal. For agencies purchasing hardware devices from the California Mobility Marketplace, the table below summarizes what networks each device is certified to operate on.
          - text: A FirstNet representative can verify eligibility for your specific use cases and also confirm network compatibility with your devices. You can contact them at <a href="mailto:rc628k@att.com">rc628k@att.com</a> and <a href="mailto:bp1401@att.com">bp1401@att.com</a>.
          - text: If your device is not eligible for FirstNet, you may still be able to get the same rates on the commercial AT&T network. Please contact the FirstNet representatives above to learn more.
