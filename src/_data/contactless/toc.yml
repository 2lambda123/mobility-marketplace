          - text: The California Department of General Services (DGS), in collaboration with Cal-ITP, conducted an RFP that established 6 Master Service Agreements (MSAs) that allow Transit Providers to purchase directly without further competitive bidding.
          - text: The MSAs allow any local government entities that operate public transportation services (“Transit Providers”) to purchase goods and services off the MSAs. Out-of-state Transit Providers—including but not limited to members of the Oregon Cooperative Procurement Program (ORCPP) and the Washington State Purchasing Cooperative (WSPC)—can also participate. Each Transit Provider should determine whether use of the MSAs is consistent with its procurement policies and regulations. California’s MSAs are generally known as State Purchasing Schedules in other states.
          - text: Projects resulting from these MSAs may be funded through grants from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and/or the State of California, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and other sources of local and state public funding. Check with your funding agencies.
